# Arduino-Artificial-Horizion
 
Arduino and Java code for an artificial horizon/attitude indicator.

#Running

First, load the arduino code onto the arduino board of your choice.

Then, download the jSerialComm library, and install it if necessary.

Go to line 123 of the java code and change the serial port. Your serial port should be something like "COM3" or "/dev/USBSerial0".

Then, you can run the java code. I have had lots of sucess on MacOS, but minor problems when running on Windows.
